# Python Web Scraping Game App

This project is about building a quotes guessing game. When run, the program will scrape a website for a collection of quotes. A quote will be picked at random and displayed. The player will have four chances to guess who said the quote. After every wrong guess they'll get a hint about the author's identity.
